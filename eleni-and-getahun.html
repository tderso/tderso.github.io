<i>The author of this narrative is an old man now aged 70 (will turn 71 next</i>
<i>May). He is a late deafened person having lost his hearing a month before he</i>
<i>turned 19 years old. By then, he had completed his 12th grade education and lost</i>
<i>his hearing a week before he was scheduled to seat for the Ethiopian Schools</i>
<i>Leaving Certificate Examination (ESLCE). The examination was used to select</i>
<i>students who could join the university.</i>
</p>


<p>
<i>After he lost his hearing, he was taken to a school for the deaf where he was</i>
<i>taught Sign Language. He was then assigned as a teacher of the deaf, a task</i>
<i>which he left after two months because of a very bad situation that he observed on</i>
<i>how the school was treating deaf students.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>He sat for the ESLCE, which he had missed the previous year and he was able to</i>
<i>join the Haileselassie First University and has graduated with Bachelor of</i>
<i>Science degree in Statistics with Mathematics as a minor area of study. He has</i>
<i>worked in a governmental organization (for two years), the ENAD (for for three</i>
<i>years) and an international organization (for nearly 27 years) until his</i>
<i>separation through retirement in 2010.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>During his time as a student, along with other deaf persons, he founded the</i>
<i>Ethiopian National Association of the Deaf (ENAD). Ever since that time, he has</i>
<i>lived and interacted with deaf persons.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Because of all the above, there are many deaf who take him as role model and he</i>
<i>need to be careful how he acts and strives very hard to act with honesty to the</i>
<i>best of his ability.</i>

<h3 id="org9c636fb">Getahun Kersa Kebede</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9c636fb">
<p>
It was when I stayed in the school for the deaf that I came to know Getahun. At
one time, I was even Getahun's teacher for a very brief period when he was a
fourth grade student. My contacts with Getahun continued even after I left the
school after we founded the ENAD. Our contacts has continued even after he moved
to the USA.
</p>

<p>
This has given me to know Getahun very closely. I know him to be a very honest
and hard working individual. Before he moved to the USA following his winning of
the US Diversity Visa Lottery, Getahun used to own a book binding business in
Addis Ababa. He was able to create employment opportunities to other deaf
persons. Even after he left for the USA, we have kept contacts first by post,
then by e-mail and now through instant messages.
</p>

<p>
Having been an elder at his first marriage, I was sad to learn about the divorce
from his former wife. But, I knew it could not be helped as his former wife
refused to listen to all mediation efforts.
</p>

<p>
After his divorce, I was one of his friends who were urging him to consider
marrying again. So, I was pleasantly surprised when he asked for my opinion on a
woman he was considering to marry.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge18e5be">
<p>
Before I came to know Eleni, I used to know her eldest sister and her other
siblings. I also knew her father, Ato Meshesha Moges. When I finally met Eleni,
she was a toddler. The toddler I first met grew up to be a very good
enterpreneur. Many women (deaf and none deaf) were given opportunities to operate small scale
businesses through support provided by the International Labor Organization
(ILO). Many failed. But, Eleni, inspite of her deafness, came out a winner of an
award by ILO. Her beads making business has prospered and she has been training
other women in beads making by using local materials that would be environmental
hazards if discarded and littered through an ILO project. Eleni was able to finance her first
condominium apartment house through her business earnings, while also supporting
her former jobless husband (RIP) and their two children.

The parents of her former husband, Ato Alemayehu Mamo Robi, had some land in Addis
Ababa. As one of the heirs, he was entitled to some of the proceeds from the
sale of the land. His family knew that if they give him the money, he will drink
it away and waste it. So, they made sure to give the money to Eleni, which she
used to buy another condominium apartment. This secomd condo has now become a
source of income from rent.
</p>

<p>
It also happened that the parents of Eleni's former husband were farmers. Their
farming lands were taken over by the expansion of Addis Ababa. The Addis Ababa
administration came up with a policy of conpensating the children of the former
farmers whose lands were eaten over by the city. As a result, Eleni's two children
and Eleni as their guardian, were able to be granted title deed to a 150 square meters plot of land
in Addis Ababa, which has now the estimated value of three million Birr.

<p>
It was a very shocking incident to every one when Ato Alemayehu died on 16
April 2018. but, giving his habitual drinking, probably it was not
unexpected. The result, Eleni was widowed at such a young age with two under age
children to take care of alone.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge61b8f7">
<p>
Getahun and Eleni are not strangers. They have known each other for a lomg time when they were married to their respective spouses. I cannot say when they started to get interested on each other. But, I guess the Getahun and Eleni must have started earlier from before the date Getahun
asked me about Eleni. I also think that Getahun started to get interested
after learning about the death of Eleni's husband. What ever the circumstances
might have been, I got a text message from Getahun on 23 August 2018 telling me
he would like to marry Eleni and what I think about her attitude. There are only four months between the date Eleni's former husband died and the date Getahun asked me about Eleni. So, I shared my views about Eleni with Getahun. Luckily, our
exchange are still in my iPhone and the following is how our exchange went.

<p>
From the above exchange with Getahun, it is obvious to me that Getahun wanted to
marry Eleni and that Eleni was not entertaining any idea about going to the
USA prior to that. After they got married, Getahun wanted her to join him in the USA.

<h3 id="org4cccc2b">Civil marriage is registered at Vital Registration Office</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4cccc2b">
<p>
The seriousness of Eleni and Getahun about their marriage could be attested by
the fact that they wanted us to perform for them all things that our culture
and tradition requires under the circumstance. The most enduring marriages are
arranged marriages. Althouth we were aware that Eleni and Getahun were
contacting each other on a daily basis and their love for each other was
growing, they wanted to demonstrate to their respective families that they were
highly commited to each other. That can only be done by following all the
traditional steps our society considers to bind a man and a woman as husband and wife.
</p>

<p>
One way to make a marriage binding in the eyes of society and the law is to get
the marriage registered. In fact, according to the Family Law of Ethiopia,
a marriage should be registered, failing that, if a man and a woman live together
for three years, in the eyes of the law, they are considered to be married. So,
we had gone to to the "Woreda" (locality) where Eleni resides and asked the
Vital Registration officials what Eleni and Getahun need to do to register a
civil marriage. We were told that Eleni must submit to them photos of herself and
Getahun. They told us that the photos will be posted at their notice board and
invite any member of the public to lodge their complaints if there is any one
who opposes the marriage from being registered.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orged8ea45">
<p>
Once Getahun and Eleni agreed to marry each other, Getahun told me about his wish to send
elders to Eleni's family to ask for her hand. His uncle Ato Mekonnen Ajebe, his
brother Ato  Dawit Kebede and myself met and discussed about the matter. Then, we agreed on
a date and we communicated with Eleni to advise her family that elders were
going to come. I was included because I am well acquainted with both families. 
</p>

<p>
As the custom dictates, we carried some token presents (A bottle of Whiskey
and one kilogram of high quality Tigrai Honey known as "Welela"). After making
all the necessary arrangements, the elders paid a visit to Eleni's family on 28
October 2018.
</p>

<p>
We stated the object of our visit to the family. Since nearly all the siblings
of Eleni know Getahun very well, we did not encounter any problems. Our proposal
for the two families to unit through marriage was accepted and the elders were
entertained by the family.
</p>

<p>
A date for the wedding was agreed. It was also agreed that the marriage will be
registered at the Vital Registration Office at which two elders from each side
of the family will be required to sign on the register. It was further agreed
that Getahun and Eleni will have to take HIV tests and produce certificates
which will be required to be submitted to the Vital Registration Office.
