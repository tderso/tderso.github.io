<p>
<i>The author of this narrative is an old man now aged 70 (will turn 71 next</i>
<i>May). He is a late deafened person having lost his hearing a month before he</i>
<i>turned 19 years old. By then, he had completed his 12th grade education and lost</i>
<i>his hearing a week before he was scheduled to seat for the Ethiopian Schools</i>
<i>Leaving Certificate Examination (ESLCE). The examination was used to select</i>
<i>students who could join the university.</i>
</p>


<p>
<i>After he lost his hearing, he was taken to a school for the deaf where he was</i>
<i>taught Sign Language. He was then assigned as a teacher of the deaf, a task</i>
<i>which he left after two months because of a very bad situation that he observed on</i>
<i>how the school was treating deaf students.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>He sat for the ESLCE, which he had missed the previous year and he was able to</i>
<i>join the Haileselassie First University and has graduated with Bachelor of</i>
<i>Science degree in Statistics with Mathematics as a minor area of study. He has</i>
<i>worked in a governmental organization (for two years), the ENAD (for for three</i>
<i>years) and an international organization (for nearly 27 years) until his</i>
<i>separation through retirement in 2010.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>During his time as a student, along with other deaf persons, he founded the</i>
<i>Ethiopian National Association of the Deaf (ENAD). Ever since that time, he has</i>
<i>lived and interacted with deaf persons.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Because of all the above, there are many deaf who take him as role model and he</i>
<i>need to be careful how he acts and strives very hard to act with honesty to the</i>
<i>best of his ability.</i>

It was when I stayed in the school for the deaf that I came to know Getahun. At
one time, I was even Getahun's teacher for a very brief period when he was a
fourth grade student. My contacts with Getahun continued even after I left the
school after we founded the ENAD. Our contacts has continued even after he moved
to the USA.
</p>

<p>
This has given me to know Getahun very closely. I know him to be a very honest
and hard working individual. Before he moved to the USA following his winning of
the US Diversity Visa Lottery, Getahun used to own a book binding business in
Addis Ababa. He was able to create employment opportunities to other deaf
persons. Even after he left for the USA, we have kept contacts first by post,
then by e-mail and now through instant messages.
</p>

<p>
Having been an elder at his first marriage, I was sad to learn about the divorce
from his former wife. But, I knew it could not be helped as his former wife
refused to listen to all mediation efforts.
</p>

<p>
After his divorce, I was one of his friends who were urging him to consider
marrying again. So, I was pleasantly surprised when he asked for my opinion on a
woman he was considering to marry.

<p>
Before I came to know Eleni, I used to know her eldest sister and her other
siblings. I also knew her father, Ato Meshesha Moges. When I finally met Eleni,
she was a toddler. The toddler I first met grew up to be a very good
enterpreneur. Many women (deaf and none deaf) were given opportunities to operate small scale
businesses through support provided by the International Labor Organization
(ILO). Many failed. But, Eleni, inspite of her deafness, came out a winner of an
award by ILO. Her beads making business has prospered and she has been training
other women in beads making by using local materials that would be environmental
hazards if discarded and littered through an ILO project. Eleni was able to finance her first
condominium apartment house through her business earnings, while also supporting
her former jobless husband (RIP) and their two children.

Eleni was on a cultural exchange tour to Finland from 20 to 27 May 2009. The
Finnish side came and selected persons with disabilities with different skills
and invited them to Finland. They demonstrated their skills to different
audience while there. This has enabled Eleni to network with individuals from
Finland who have been ordering her beads on a yearly basis.

<p>
The parents of her former husband, Ato Alemayehu Mamo Robi, had some land in Addis
Ababa. As one of the heirs, he was entitled to some of the proceeds from the
sale of the land. His family knew that if they give him the money, he will drink
it away and waste it. So, they made sure to give the money to Eleni, which she
used to buy another condominium apartment. This secomd condo has now become a
source of income from rent.
</p>

<p>
It also happened that the parents of Eleni's former husband were farmers. Their
farming lands were taken over by the expansion of Addis Ababa. The Addis Ababa
administration came up with a policy of conpensating the children of the former
farmers whose lands were eaten over by the city. As a result, Eleni's two children
and Eleni as their guardian, were able to be granted title deed to a 150 square meters plot of land
in Addis Ababa, which has now the estimated value of three million Birr.

<p>
It was a very shocking incident to every one when Ato Alemayehu died on 16
April 2018. but, giving his habitual drinking, probably it was not
unexpected. The result, Eleni was widowed at such a young age with two under age
children to take care of alone.

<p>
Getahun and Eleni are not strangers. They have known each other for a long time when they were married to their respective spouses. I cannot say when they started to get interested on each other. But, I guess the Getahun and Eleni must have started earlier from before the date Getahun
asked me about Eleni. I also think that Getahun started to get interested
after learning about the death of Eleni's husband. What ever the circumstances
might have been, I got a text message from Getahun on 23 August 2018 telling me
he would like to marry Eleni and what I think about her attitude. There are only four months between the date Eleni's former husband died and the date Getahun asked me about Eleni. So, I shared my views about Eleni with Getahun. Luckily, our
exchange are still in my iPhone and the following is how our exchange went.

<p>
From the above exchange with Getahun, it is obvious to me that Getahun wanted to
marry Eleni and that Eleni was not entertaining any idea about going to the
USA prior to that. After they got married, Getahun wanted her to join him in the USA.

<div id="outline-container-org4cccc2b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org4cccc2b">Civil marriage is registered at Vital Registration Office</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4cccc2b">
<p>
The seriousness of Eleni and Getahun about their marriage could be attested by
the fact that they wanted us to perform for them all things that our culture
and tradition requires under the circumstance. The most enduring marriages are
arranged marriages. Althouth we were aware that Eleni and Getahun were
contacting each other on a daily basis and their love for each other was
growing, they wanted to demonstrate to their respective families that they were
highly commited to each other. That can only be done by following all the
traditional steps our society considers to bind a man and a woman as husband and wife.
</p>

<p>
One way to make a marriage binding in the eyes of society and the law is to get
the marriage registered. In fact, according to the Family Law of Ethiopia,
a marriage should be registered, failing that, if a man and a woman live together
for three years, in the eyes of the law, they are considered to be married. So,
we had gone to to the "Woreda" (locality) where Eleni resides and asked the
Vital Registration officials what Eleni and Getahun need to do to register a
civil marriage. We were told that Eleni must submit to them photos of herself and
Getahun. They told us that the photos will be posted at their notice board and
invite any member of the public to lodge their complaints if there is any one
who opposes the marriage from being registered.

<p>
Once Getahun and Eleni agreed to marry each other, Getahun told me about his wish to send
elders to Eleni's family to ask for her hand. His uncle Ato Mekonnen Ajebie, his
brother Ato  Dawit Kebede and myself met and discussed about the matter. Then, we agreed on
a date and we communicated with Eleni to advise her family that elders were
going to come. I was included because I am well acquainted with both families. 
</p>

<p>
As the custom dictates, we carried some token presents (A bottle of Whiskey
and one kilogram of high quality Tigrai Honey known as "Welela"). After making
all the necessary arrangements, the elders paid a visit to Eleni's family on 28
October 2018.
</p>

<p>
We stated the object of our visit to the family. Since nearly all the siblings
of Eleni know Getahun very well, we did not encounter any problems. Our proposal
for the two families to unit through marriage was accepted and the elders were
entertained by the family.
</p>

<p>
A date for the wedding was agreed. It was also agreed that the marriage will be
registered at the Vital Registration Office at which two elders from each side
of the family will be required to sign on the register. It was further agreed
that Getahun and Eleni will have to take HIV tests and produce certificates
which will be required to be submitted to the Vital Registration Office.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd68fe45">
<p>
Before Getahun arrived from the USA in Addis Ababa, Eleni, Dawit (Getahun's
brother) and myself had to look for a place where Eleni and Getahun were going
to stay. Although Eleni has her own condos, they were rented out to others. What
is more, her condos are located far away from the center of Addis Ababa. Some
where around the center of Addis Ababa is more accessible to their respective
families and friends. Her own residence at the time was unsuitable as her
children and other family members were with her and Eleni and Getahun would not
get the privacy they need to get to know each other intimately.
</p>

<p>
So, we located a furnished condominium apartment for them to be used for one
month. Except for two nights during the wedding, where they had stayed at the Blue
Cave Hotel as part of the contract for holding the wedding there, they had
stayed at the condo until Getahun returned to the USA.

no one came forwards opposing the union, they were good to proceed. Accordingly,
the vital details of the bride, the groom and their respective elders (two

<h3 id="org32c6217">USCIS's assessment about Eleni's elegibility for an immigrant visa</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org32c6217">
<p>
Getahun Kersa Kebede's (or as we know him in the Ethiopian naming convention as
Getahun Kebede Kersa) petition to be allowed for Eleni Meshesha Moges to to
immigrate to the USA, I understand, is based on US Law and USICS was correct to
approve the the petition and pass it to the State Department for action.
</p>

<p>
The problem that I see with the process is based on the consular officer who
interviewwed Eleni has misunderstood or misinterpreted the information Eleni
gave him.
</p>

<p>
I am the one who helped Eleni to fill in the I-130 form. So, I know for sure
where the problem is.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>Eleni Meshesha is an intelligent woman. But, she lacks adequate knowledge
that could only be obtained through rigorous education. The Ethiopian
Educational System has deteriorated during the Derg and had not fared any
better during the time of the EPRDF government. When we consider about
education of the deaf, it is almost non-existent. So, not only Eleni but
nearly most deaf persons do not understand about the subtilities of
genealogical relationships. To most deaf like Eleni, saying a brother is a
relative does not make sence to them. They reserve the word "relative" for
some one who is not close enough and in Ethiopia, we count relationships
upto the seventh generation. We do not allow marriages between close
relatives unless the relationship has passed seven generations.</p></li>
<li><p>While helping Eleni with the D-160 form, I had asked her if she has any
relatives who reside in the USA. She had answered no. But, I knew that she
had a brother in the USA, who had immigrated by winning the Diversity Visa
Program. When I reminded her about that, she said he is her brother and not
her relative. I had explained to her about the meaning of relative. But, that
was some time ealier and by the time she went for the interview, it seems she
had reverted to her former way of thinking about relationships.</p></li>
<li><p>The Consular officer reported he asked her two times if she has a any
relative in the USA. Eleni remembers it that he did so. But, the Consular
officer failed to report that he had asked her a third time about her brother
to which she had replied in the affirmative. If Eleni had said no to the
third direct question about her brother, I would have credited the consular
officer's conclusion. If Eleni had any plan to hide from US officials about
her brother, she would not have reported it in her DS-260 form. From this, it
is very clear to me Eleni's interpretation of relative was very different
from the normal one. She failed to understand that her brother could be said
to be her relative. She had no plan or wish to misliead or tell a lie.</p></li>
<li><p>
There is also what the consular officer reported about her father residing in
the USA gleaned from NVC prescreening which is not correct. I belive that
information has also contributed for the consular officer to arrive at an
erronous conclusion.
</p>

<p>
Eleni's brother, was initially residing in California. But, he moved to the
Eastern USA and has been living there ever since.
</p>

<p>I very much suspect her brother Ayalneh Meshesha Moges
has changed his name to Ayalneh Moges Meshesha making it look as if Eleni's
father Meshesha Moges were living in the USA. In Ethiopia, we do not have the
concept of family name. Every one is called by his given name and father's
name. When even we are uncertain about the identity of a person from his
given and father's names, we ask for the grand father's name. However, on
documents like passports, birth certificates and the like, the given name,
the father's name and the grand father's name are recorded. When a persons
goes abroad like the USA, the authorities take the grand father's name as the
familt name. That action can render an Ethiopian very hard to tell by
Ethiopians back home. While working in an international organization that
brought nationals of many different countries, we Ethiopiand had a problem
with this naming scheme. Finally, the organization adopted the convention of
putting our grand fathers' names as the middle name.
</p>

<p>
To come back to Ayalneh Meshesha Moges, if he were to write back to his
friends as Ayakneh Moges, who knew him as Ayalneh Meshesha, none of them
would know him. When Getahun immigrated to the USA, he came to be called
Getahun Kersa, a name we had never heard while he was in Ethiopia. So, he
had his name changed to Getahun Kersa Kebede. Now, he can write his name as
Getahun Kebede and every one of us will know who that is.
</p>

<p>
Ayalneh Meshesha Moges (Ayalneh Moges) and Ayalneh Moges Meshesha (Ayalneh
Meshesha) are one and the same person. The prescreening did not find any new person.
As to Ato Meshesha Moges Lidetu, Elenei's father, he died on 1 October 1998
and was buried at Makanissa Abo Church. He has never been to the USA at all. The only
country he had been to is Korea as part of the Ethiopian Peace Keeping
Mission.
</p></li>
<li><p>The consular officer said that the beneficiary was "&#x2026; unable to to present
convincing evidence of regular, substantive communication with
petitioner. &#x2026;". First of all, Getahun and Eleni could not have entered into
any love relationship while Eleni was married to her former husband. Her
former husband died on 18 April 2018. Getahun seems to have made a firm
decision to marry Eleni on or around 23 August 2018. Eleni's and Geathun's
marriage was registered on 7 November 2018. assuming the idea of marrying
Eleni arose to Getahun afrer he leaned about the death of her former huband,
there are only 7 months and 19 days between the death of Eleni's former
husband and the registration of her marriage to Getahun. But, getahun could
not have started right away as he would want to give her some time to mourn
the loss of her husband. They must have started communicating in earnest
after their close friends approved their relationship.</p></li>
<li><p>I know for sure that Eleni and Getahun were communicating on a regular basis
using IMO. Some one planning to cheat would make sure to collect material
that he/she thinks would convince consular officials. Eleni and Getahun did
not have any such plans. They trusted to every thing that they had done,
which were based on legal grounds. They did not have any doubt on the
truthfulness of every action that had taken. As the consular official had
noted, they were atempting to communicate as the many failed comnnections
show. It should also be noted that Ethiopia was going through a very
difficult time during which the network was being deliberately
disconnected. Because of eelni's limited ability to communicate through text
messages, they were using IMO video chat. But, their communications by video
chat have not been archived. If they had known they were going to be asked
for such materials, they weould have made every effort to save them.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the text chat I had, which luckily still exist in my iPhone, show the
thinking Getahun had on the matter, that he sincerely wanted to marry and
unite his life with Eleni.</p></li>
<li><p>Economically, Eleni is not in need of any thing. I know very well before
Getahun proposed to her, she had no plan of going to the USA. She was
working very hard to put her life and her children's on a firm economic
basis. Even now, if her application is approved, what she is planning to do
is pass half of the year in Ethiopia and the other half in the USA. Because,
she would like to oversee her business here. Thank God, she is not an
economic migrant.</p></li>
<li><p>The consular official raised the matter of age difference. That is
surprising. Since when has love taken age difference in to consideration?</p></li>
