<h2 id="org7d17f08">About Eleni Meshesha and Getahun Kebede</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7d17f08">
<p>
I have known Eleni Meshesha Moges and Getahun Kersa Kebede and their respective
families for a very long time.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgdf439aa" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgdf439aa">About myself</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdf439aa">
<p>
I am an old man now aged 70 (will turn 71 next May). I am a late deafened person
having lost my hearing a month before I turned 19 years old. By then, I had compeleted my 12th grade
education and lost my hearing a week before I was scheduled to seat for the
Ethiopian Schools Leavining Certificate Examination (ESLCE). The examination was used to
select students who could join the university.
</p>

<p>
After I lost my hearing, I was taken to a school for the deaf where I was
taught Sign Language. I was then assigned as a teacher of the deaf, a task
which I left after two months because of a very had situation that I observed on
how the school was treating deaf students.
</p>

<p>
I sat for the ESLCE, which I had missed
the previous year and I was able to join the Haileselassie First University and
have graduated with Bachelor of Science degree in Statistics with Mathematics as
a minor area of study. I have worked in a governmental organization (for two years), the
ENAD (for for three years) and an international organization (for nearly 27
years) until my separation through retirement in 2010.
</p>

<p>
During my time as a student, along with other deaf persons, I founded the
Ethiopian National Association of the Deaf (ENAD). Ever since that time, I have
lived and interacted with the deaf.
</p>

<p>
Because of all the above, there are many deaf who take me as role model and I
need to be careful how I act and strive very hard to act with honesty to the
best of my ability.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org9c636fb" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9c636fb">Getahun Kersa Kebede</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9c636fb">
<p>
It was when I stayed in the school for the deaf that I came to know Getahun. At
one time, I was even Getahun's teacher for a very brief period when he was a
fourth grade student. My contacts with Getahun continued even after I left the
school after we founded the ENAD. Our contacts has continued even after he moved
to the USA.
</p>

<p>
This has given me to know Getahun very closely. I know him to be a very honest
and hard working individual. Before he moved to the USA following his winning of
the US Diversity Visa Lottery, Getahun used to own a book binding business in
Addis Ababa. He was able to create employment opportunities to other deaf
persons. Even after he left for the USA, we have kept contacts first by post,
then by e-mail and now through instant messages.
</p>

<p>
Having been an elder at his first marriage, I was sad to learn about the divorce
from his former wife. But, I knew it could not be helped as his former wife
refused to listen to all mediation efforts.
</p>

<p>
After his divorce, I was one of his friends who were urging him to consider
marrying again. So, I was pleasantly surprised when he asked for my opinion on a
woman he was considering to marry.

<h3 id="orge18e5be">Eleni Meshesha Moges</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge18e5be">
<p>
Before I came to know Eleni, I used to know her eldest sister and her other
siblings. I also knew her father, Ato Meshesha Moges. When I finally met Eleni,
she was a toddler. The toddler I first met grew up to be a very good
enterpreneur. Many women (deaf and none deaf) were given opportunities to operate small scale
businesses through support provided by the International Labor Organization
(ILO). Many failed. But, Eleni, inspite of her deafness, came out a winner of an
award by ILO. Her beads making business has prospered and she has been training
other women in beads making by using local materials that would be environmental
hazards if discarded and littered through an ILO project. Eleni was able to finance her first
condominium apartment house through her business earnings, while also supporting
her former jobless husband (RIP) and their two children.

<p>
The parents of her former husband, Ato Alemayehu Mamo Robi, had some land in Addis
Ababa. As one of the heirs, he was entitled to some of the proceeds from the
sale of the land. His family knew that if they give him the money, he will drink
it away and waste it. So, they made sure to give the money to Eleni, which she
used to buy another condominium apartment. This secomd condo has now become a
source of income from rent.
</p>

<p>
It also happened that the parents of Eleni's former husband were farmers. Their
farming lands were taken over by the expansion of Addis Ababa. The Addis Ababa
administration came up with a policy of conpensating the children of the former
farmers whose lands were eaten over by the city. As a result, Eleni's two children
and Eleni as their guardian, were able to be granted title deed to a plot of land
in Addis Ababa, which has now the estimated value of three million Birr.

</div>


<p>
It was a very shocking incident to every one when Ato Alemayehu died on 16
April 2018. but, giving his habitual drinking, probably it was not
unexpected. The result, Eleni was widowed at such a young age with two under age
children to take care of alone.

<h3 id="orge61b8f7">Getahun asked for my opinion about Eleni</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge61b8f7">
<p>
Getahun and Eleni are not strangers. They have known each other for a lomg time when they were married to their respective spouses. I cannot say when they started to get interested on each other. But, I guess the Getahun and Eleni must have started earlier from before the date Getahun
asked me about Eleni. I also think that Getahun started to get interested
after learning about the death of Eleni's husband. What ever the circumstances
might have been, I got a text message from Getahun on 23 August 2018 telling me
he would like to marry Eleni and what I think about her attitude. There are only four months between the date Eleni's former husband died and the date Getahun asked me about Eleni. So, I shared my views about Eleni with Getahun. Luckily, our
exchange are still in my iPhone and the following is how our exchange went.

<p>
From the above exchange with Getahun, it is obvious to me that Getahun wanted to
marry Eleni and that Eleni was not entertaining any idea about going to the
USA prior to that. After they got married, Getahun wanted her to join him in the USA.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgc2994a2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc2994a2">Elders went to ask for Eleni's hand</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc2994a2">
<p>
Once Getahun and Eleni agreed to marry each other, Getahun asked me to send
elders to Eleni's family to ask for her hand. His uncle Ato Mekonnen Ajebe, his
brother Ato  Dawit Kebede and myself met and discussed about the matter. Then, we agreed on
a date and we communicated with Eleni to advise her family that elders were
going to come. I was included because I am well acquainted with both families. 
</p>

<p>
As the custom dictates, we carried some token presents (A bottle of Whiskey
and one kilogram of high quality Tigrai Honey known as "Welela"). After making
all the necessary arangements, the elders paid a visit to Eleni's family on 28
October 2018.
</p>

<p>
We stated the object of our visit to the family. Since nearly all the siblings
of Eleni know Getahun very well, we did not encounter any problems. Our proposal
for the two families to unit through marriage was accepted and the elders were
entertained by the family.
</p>

<p>
A date for the wedding was agreed. It was also agreed that the marriage will be
registered at the Vital Registration Office at which two elders from each side
of the family will be required to sign on the register. It was furrher agreed
that Getahun and Eleni will have to take HIV tests and produce certificates
which will be required to be submitted to the Vital Registration Office.
