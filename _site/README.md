# About Be'ati Hagosa

Be'ati Hagosa is a locality where this developer grew up. Be'ati Hagosa means Cave of Happiness. It was a rural locality at the time. Now, it falls within the boundaries of the city of Adigrat, in the Eastern Zone of Tigrai.

While developing this website, I am learning:
1. Static site development using Jekyll
2. Cascading Style sheet (CSS) and other related technologies
3. JavaScript
4. Also Ruby
