### Flight from Addis to Mekelle

* Arrived early. We had checked in before arrival. But, there was no special desk ready for web checking as _ETHIOPIAN_ advises.
* Boarded before 6:30 am. We were the first to do so as I had noted the gate and we had sat near it.
* Plane was 737-800 series.
* Started taxing at 7:08 am but stopped.
* Resumed taxing at 7:29 am.
* Landed at 8:18 am.

We took taxi. We told the guy to pass by Romanat Square and drop me there before he goes to the bus terminal as I was staying in Mekelle for one night.

* Taxi fare:-
   * To bus terminal Birr 250.00
   * To Romanat Square Birr 150.00
* Bed at Dove was Birr 350.00 a night.
* Dinner with Gidey Birr 83.00. We had _Fool_ with yoghurt from the establishment.
* Factory produced yoghuty bought at supermarket (two small cups) Birr 50.00.

### Meeting with some deaf

The reason for passing a night in Mekelke was in order to talk about the article by Leul published in the Internet. Tge article has many errors of facts. So, I had a meeting with:
1. Leul Tesfamichael
2. Abraham Asfaha
3. Gidey Tadesse
4. Awet Gebremariam
5. Tadesse

We have made  Leul to understand where he went wrong. He appeared to accept. He has said he will ask them he wants to make edits on it. 

In the afternoon, we went to the location called Diaspora Abraha and Gidey where teachers are building houses. We met Tadesse there and later, we also met Awet driving a car. He drove us back to town.
