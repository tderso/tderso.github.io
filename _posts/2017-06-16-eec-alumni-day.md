The Ethiopian Evangelical College was a high school and college located at Bishoftu (Debre Zeit) and operated by evangelists from the nordic countries and the USA. Until it closed down during the reign of the Derg, it had educated many Ethiopians and even non-Ethiopians, many of whom went to play leadership roles in the country.

Alumni members, who started meeting through the Internet in a Yahoo Group (now moved to Groups.io), had been agitating for the re-opening of the college. After some time, the property, which was being used as a military barrack, has been given back to the Ethiopian Evangelical Mekane Yesus Church. Through the generous assistance of a phlantropist, the school, which has been highly damaged, has been renovated. The Mekane Yesus Church has now made the place part of the Mekane Yesus University, that has been under establishment.

An alumni day was organized by the leadership of the new college and many former students were present at the event.
