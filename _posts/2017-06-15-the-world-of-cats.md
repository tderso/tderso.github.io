they will spend most of the day time sleeping. Then, towards the evening, they like to get out and explore their surroundings, marking territory.   
Cats and dogs are mostly enemies. But, if properly trained, they make good friends. It is the dog that learns quickly to tolerate the cat however. The cat will continue playing tricks on the poor dog.
