### First Visit to Be'ati Hagosa

Askale had visited yesterday. But, her purpose was to pay her condolence on the death of _Adey Kib'atu_. So, today's visit is a second for Askale while it is a first for me.

We had agreed with Askale to meet at Be'ati Hagosa at 8:00 am. I arrived there almost on time. I took the bajjaj to what they call _Bar Lewahit_, a location some meters down from what we used to call _Tchegura_. It might match the place where Ato Habtu died from lightening strike. From there, I walked to Be'ati Hagosa.

I took one kilogram of coffee (Birr 120.00) and gave it to Fana, Woldegebriel's daughter.
