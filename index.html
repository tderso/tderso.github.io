			  Be'ati Hagosa is a village located in the Eastern Zone of Tigray Regional state. It is near the town of Adigrat and is almost swallowed by the town now. Adigrat University is only 0.5 kms. away from it. The place used to be quite forested and teaming with different wild life. Some of the wild life that were frequently seen are foxes, apes, squirrels, lizards, porcupines, rock hyraxes, different types of birds such as partridges, eagles, black hawks, lammergeiers, etc. The place is mountainous.

			<p>
    		Now, the place is denuded of trees and is barren except for some eucaliptus trees and the prickly pear, which are human grown and not natural trees that existed there before. The prickly pear tree was non-existent in the past. Now, it has almost taken over every place and might need to be controlled if its current rate of expansion continues. Nearly all the wild life are also gone although the rock hyraxes are still holding their own.

  		<p>
    		As mentioned above, the rate of expansion of the prickly pear tree is alarming. However, it is of very high economical importance in the area. Its ability to cope in dry areas and to grow even on rockey terrient with little or no soil has made it the plant of choice for soil errosion control. During times of draught, its pads are also used as cattle feed. Its delicious fruit is also highy valued as it fruits during the Ethiopian rainy season (the "Kiremt") when other sources of food stuff are low or none existent. In fact, in recent times, the fruit has started to be sent as far as Addis Ababa as a commodity of sale.

						You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
