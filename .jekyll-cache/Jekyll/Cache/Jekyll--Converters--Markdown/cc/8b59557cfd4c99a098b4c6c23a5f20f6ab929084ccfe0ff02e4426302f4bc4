<p>The reason for passing a night in Mekelke was in order to talk about the article by Leul published in the Internet. Tge article has many errors of facts. So, I had a meeting with:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Leul Tesfamichael</li>
  <li>Abraham Asfaha</li>
  <li>Gidey Tadesse</li>
  <li>Awet Gebremariam</li>
  <li>Tadesse</li>
</ol>

<p>We have made  Leul to understand where he went wrong. He appeared to accept. He has said he will ask them he wants to make edits on it.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, we went to the location called Diaspora Abraha and Gidey where teachers are building houses. We met Tadesse there and later, we also met Awet driving a car. He drove us back to town.</p>
