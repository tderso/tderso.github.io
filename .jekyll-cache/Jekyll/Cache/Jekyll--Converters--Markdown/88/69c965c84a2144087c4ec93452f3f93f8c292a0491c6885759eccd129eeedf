<h3 id="first-visit-to-beati-hagosa">First Visit to Be’ati Hagosa</h3>

<p>Askale had visited yesterday. But, her purpose was to pay her condolence on the death of <em>Adey Kib’atu</em>. So, today’s visit is a second for Askale while it is a first for me.</p>

<p>We had agreed with Askale to meet at Be’ati Hagosa at 8:00 am. I arrived there almost on time. I took the bajjaj to what they call <em>Bar Lewahit</em>, a location some meters down from what we used to call <em>Tchegura</em>. It might match the place where Ato Habtu died from lightening strike. From there, I walked to Be’ati Hagosa.</p>

<p>I took one kilogram of coffee (Birr 120.00) and gave it to Fana, Woldegebriel’s daughter.</p>
